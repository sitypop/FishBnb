## Features

* User can signup, log in and log out
* User can list a new space
* Users can list multiple spaces
* Users can name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
* User can offer a range of dates where their space is available
* User can request to hire any space
* When a request has been made, it has to be approved by the user that owns that space
* Once it's approved, a booking is made

* Nights for which a space has already been booked are then no longer available for users to book that space
